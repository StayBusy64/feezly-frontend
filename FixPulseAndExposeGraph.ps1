.SYNOPSIS
  Expose the ForceGraph3D instance globally and guard against missing nodes in the pulse script.

.DESCRIPTION
  - In `feezly-3d-brain.html`, replaces
      const Graph = ForceGraph3D()...
    with
      window.Graph = ForceGraph3D()...
  - In `pulse-animation.js`, wraps the node lookup in a guard so it skips unknown IDs instead of throwing.
  - Stages, commits, and pushes the changes.
